## HOW TO

### General
Just to be clear (for now) this won't made for you a main menu and (or) option menu.   
This only help you to manage the different thread/activity/view/gameloop for the scene activity

### Add the engine to your game

travel to the directory of your app, clone the repo and add module dependency to your project

    git clone https://github.com/HerdeliasLegacy/openpixelengine.git
    android studio : File > import module > chose the clone dir as source
    let gradle finish ... that all
